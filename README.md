Project website for INEW 2434

This project runs on localhost:1111
To open the project in your browser run the "MidtermApplication.java" file.

On the main index page you can select the "Inventory Management" link at the top to view all the flowers in our database.
From this page you can then edit, remove, and add to the inventory.

To add a flower to the inventory list scroll to the bottom and select "Create New Flower".

To edit a current flower on the list select "Edit" next to the flower you want to remove.
In the edit menu you can add the ID, flower image, name, and quantity.
When adding the flower image be sure that the url ends in .jpg or .png.
The flower image section takes a url up to 1000 characters long, if your link is longer than that then you'll need to shorten it or find a different image.

To remove a flower from the list select "Remove" next to the flower you want to remove.
