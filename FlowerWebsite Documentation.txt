For this project I use Spring Boot and My SQL Database to create a website which acts as an inventory for different types of flowers. Although it is simple in design and function it can be very helpful for small business and even personal use. On our index page we have a small design which features some of the flowers in our inventory. To go to our inventory we click the link above which says “Inventory Management” and we’ll be taken to our list. On this list we have our inventory of flowers which includes a flower’s ID, image, name, quantity, an option to edit the flower, remove the flower, and add a new one.
        All pages for the website are built on JSP meaning I get to work with both Java code and HTML. To run the project we run the “MidtermApplication” java file which gets Spring Boot running and launches our site. We have a CSS file as well which has the styling for our pages. Our website connects to My SQL database schema “flower” where I have the id, img, fname, and quantity for each flower. This database will get updated each time a change to our site is made.
